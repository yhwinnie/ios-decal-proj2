## Due
Monday, October 19 at 11:59 PM

## Description
We've explored quite a bit with iOS development, and learned how to make simple
apps. Continuing this trend, we are eventually going to make a full-on iOS
Hangman game for our next project. This homework assignment is dealing with some
preliminiaries and setting up some of the first steps for creating the Hangman
game. Namely, we will be using our newly acquired UI knowledge to create the
View for the game.

## Instructions
1. Fork the assignment's repository from (https://github.com/iosdecal).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine (the URL should contain
   YOUR_USERNAME/ios-decal-..).
3. **Add to HangmanViewController.swift and Main.Storyboard**
  * Required
    * A "New Game" Button (to start a New Game)
    * A "Guess" Button (for the user to submit a Guess)
    * A Textfield (where user enters a letter as a guess)
    * A UILabel that indicates what guesses have been made
    * A square-dimensioned UIImageView that will represent the "state" of the Hangman
    * Any necessary constraints for all subviews
4. Add, commit, and push your modified file(s) to your forked remote repository.
